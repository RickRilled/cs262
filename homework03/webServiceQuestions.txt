a)Yes the service is RESTful. It implemnts HTTP methods consistant with the CRUD design. It is also statless, and connects it's resources with unique URIs, depending on which method is being called.
b)GET, PUT, and DELETE are Indempotent, because after the first call, subsequent calls do not change any information. POST is nullipotent, because sibsequent requests after the first one will change the information in the system. Constantly updating information for the soldier collection will add new entries each time POST is called. 
c)When an object is created, the internal operations are kept to itself beacuse of encapsulation. Rrelational databases require infomration on what's going on to build relations to each individual object. Becuase of this conflict, we must violents the encapsulating properties of the object. 
d)My intution says no. There is no entry point to enter dastardly SQL queries. Because of this, you need specific access to the database that only the creator has, which turns into getting a password and an expanded hacking operation.
