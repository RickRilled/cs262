a)I have some bias since I took their user test and got to experience it first hand. However, I was very impressed. The test was very well thought out and I got to experience the whole app. There was a balance between telling me what to do and letting me play around with each page. The testers were well prepared and were responsive and knowledgeable when I had a question. One gave the test while another kept notes. Both were active in the test. Since it was me and another subject, we could think together and bounce ideas before coming up with a plan. I was in general impressed and enjoyed the experience. 

b)There is plenty of code pushed to github currently. Each member seems to activly be participating and new updates are consistant.
