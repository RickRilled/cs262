	I have always been impressed with the work each individual put into Pinder. They were very good at communicating with us and providing feedback/insight on the app and accepting our recommendations. Their trello/github show activity throughout the semester working on different aspects of the project, as I’ve always seen. Though I really enjoyed their presentation, I felt a little pandered to. The dog was a very nice touch, and I enjoyed showing it some love, but it felt more like a sales pitch than a technical presentation. Still, the functionality was there and I enjoyed seeing the app grow. I think their midway presentation was technically better, but this was more entertaining. 
	The final deliverable was surprising well implemented with how many ideas they had. The UI flowed well, and they fixed the problem of having to press the back button 5 or 6 times to get back to the home page.  There is a bug that caused the matches to not appear in the “my matches” page. The UI looks very nice and polished, with images and logos that help make the experience of using it enjoyable. I think this team did an excellent job and I enjoyed watching the process.
